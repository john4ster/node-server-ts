# Node Server TypeScript Setup
This repo provides some boilerplate code for setting up a Node server with TypeScript.

# Usage
1. Download the files into your desired directory
2. Run `npm install` in the directory to install the required packages
3. Run `npm run dev` in the directory to start the development server at locahost 3001
4. Visit http://localhost:3001 to confirm that the message from the server is displayed

You can also run `npm run build` to compile to a JavaScript file, and `npm run start` to run the compiled file.
